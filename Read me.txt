--------- why I made separate layers of buidings ----------
-- for better performance in pgadmin (to have a layer with less count of feature)
-- will be be easier in visualization 
-- I gave it the name followed by _hala so you can know who to ask in case you wanna inquire about something.
-- I didn't change the original layers to not interrupt your work.

--------- why I did not use the information field as a ditionary ----------
-- to reduce the time of making sql quries every time I want to get a spesific value
-- to will be complex to make some kinds of statitics on data we get by a query, also hard to verify the results
-- separating the values out of information field will make it easier to calculate statistics in dashboard
